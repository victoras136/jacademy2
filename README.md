# Employee Management System - A PwC Java Academy Project

Welcome to the Employee Management System project repository! This project is part of our workshop/academy aiming to introduce students to modern technologies in software development, quality assurance, security, and DevOps practices. In this hands-on project, we explore the Spring Boot framework with Java 17, Maven, ReactJS, PostgreSQL with Docker, and Bootstrap for the UI.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a simple Employee Management System with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities. The application allows users to manage employee records efficiently. With the integration of Spring Boot and ReactJS, the project showcases the power of full-stack development and the seamless interaction between frontend and backend technologies.

- **Spring Boot**: Backend framework for building robust Java applications.
- **Java 17**: One of the latest versions of the Java programming language for building enterprise-grade applications.
- **Maven**: Dependency management and build automation tool.
- **ReactJS**: JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.
- **PostgreSQL**: Powerful open-source relational database system.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform for easy deployment and scaling of applications.
- **Bootstrap**: Frontend framework for creating responsive and visually appealing web pages.
